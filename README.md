SECOND HAND CAR PRICE PREDICTION MODEL.

This project is an end-to-end implementation of a machine learning model to predict the prices of second-hand cars. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and originally comes from the Cardekho website. The project leverages regression models to train the dataset and predict car prices. Specifically, it uses RandomSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters and a Random Forest Regression estimator, which achieves an r2 score of 0.933.
